                <p class="text-small">Be-educate is an online course learning app.E-learning and ed-tech companies are the new beginnings that will revolutionise the whole education process. Online learning has become more convenient with the use of advanced science and technology. In this changing world, online classes have become more accessible. Online classes have made our learning process more manageable with our busy schedules. Online classes have been beneficial to students who do not have access to proper schooling and quality education. Ed-tech platforms are now helping students as well as teachers with different study materials, various online courses, etc., at a very reasonable cost so that education can be accessible and available to all grades of students. Online classes help students and teachers excel academically even better than offline classes because they get their own space for learning. They can learn in their own comfort zone. During the pandemic, online classes have been beneficial to the students and their parents to keep the children engaged with their studies.</p>

        <p class="text-big">C++</p>
        
        <p class="text-small">C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

            C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
            
            C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
            
            C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
            
            C++ is fun and easy to learn!
            C++  is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as of 1997 C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[13]

C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[14] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[14] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

        <p class="text-big">Java</p>
        
        <p class="text-small">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

            Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub[19] and it is ranked fourth on TIOBE index as of October 2023.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21]
            
            Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.</p>

        <p class="text-small">Design and analysis of algorithms is a crucial subject of computer science technology that deals with developing and studying efficient algorithms for fixing computational issues. It entails several steps, which includes problem formulation, algorithm layout, algorithm analysis, and algorithm optimization.

            The problem formulation process entails identifying the computational problem to be solved as well as specifying the input and output criteria. The algorithm design process entails creating a set of instructions that a computer can use to solve the problem. The algorithm analysis process entails determining the method's efficiency in terms of time and space complexity. Finally, the algorithm optimization process involves enhancing the method's efficiency by making changes to the design or implementation.
            
            There are several strategies for any algorithm's design and evaluation, including brute force algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Each method has its very own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of approach depends on the nature of the problem being solved.
            
            Algorithm analysis is often performed by examining the algorithm's worst-case time and space complexity. The time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time it takes to clear up a problem as a characteristic of the input size. The space complexity of an algorithm refers to the quantity of memory required to solve a problem as a function of the enter length.</p>
